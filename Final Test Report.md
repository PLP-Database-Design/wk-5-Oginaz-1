## Project Overview

**System Under Test:** Word Puzzle Game Plus  
**Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Environment:** Chrome Browser (Desktop)

### Features Under Test

| Feature | Description | Risk Category |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Reset Game | Clears score and progress instantly | High ‚Äî State integrity & control flow |
| Leaderboard | Stores top 3 scores in localStorage | Medium ‚Äî Data persistence & sorting |
| Bonus Round | Every 3 puzzles ‚Üí doubles score | Medium ‚Äî Logic correctness & sequencing |

## Test Plan

### Objectives

- Functionality Verification: Ensure Reset, Leaderboard, and Bonus Round work as specified.
- Data Integrity: Validate score calculation, leaderboard persistence, and state management.
- Risk Mitigation: Focus tests on high-risk areas (localStorage, bonus logic, edge cases).
- Quality Assurance: Maintain stability, UX quality, and data consistency across flows.
- Team Collaboration: Demonstrate effective planning, execution, and monitoring.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Functional Testing:
  - Reset Game state management
  - Leaderboard storage/retrieval from localStorage
  - Bonus Round calculation and trigger logic
  - Score calculation with and without hints
  - Puzzle scrambling and validation
  - Hint display and cost deduction
- Non-Functional Testing:
  - Usability and accessibility
  - Browser compatibility (Chrome desktop)
  - UI responsiveness
  - Error handling and edge cases

**Out of Scope:**
- Cross-browser testing beyond Chrome desktop
- Performance testing under load
- Security testing of localStorage
- Mobile device testing
- Network connectivity scenarios
- Backend server integration

### Tools & Resources

- Test Environment: Chrome Browser (Desktop) ‚Äî latest stable
- Repository Management: GitHub
- Defect Management: GitHub Issues
- Documentation: Markdown files
- Communication: GitHub and WhatsApp
- Test Data: Built-in word bank

### Schedule

| Phase | Planned Duration | Actual Duration | Status |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Planning | 2 days | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Design | 1 day | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Execution | 3 days | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Reporting | 1 day | [TBD] | [TBD] |

## Risk Analysis

### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
|R01 |Reset Button |Game state may not reset all variables |Medium |High |High |Validate all state variables and UI values reset correctly |
|R02 |Leader Board |Incorrect Score sorting or overwriting of scores |Medium |Medium |Critical |Test boundary values and local storage persistence |
|R03 |Bonus Round |Logic error could double at wrong time |Medium |Medium |Medium |Test with cumulative solves and verify arithmetic logic |
|R04 |Hint Bonus |Hint points may not be deducted when score is zero |Medium |Medium |High |Validate deduction logic and arithmetic |
|R05 |Input Validation |Empty input   |low |Medium |Low |Add validation message and error messages |
|R06 |UI |Screen readers may not get updates |Low |Medium |Low |Verify Accessibility tags in Browser |
|R07 |Submit Button |Clicking submit rapidly multiple times before next puzzle loads causing repeated score increments and false bonus triggers. |High |High |High |Disable Submit and Hint buttons immediately after a correct guess, and re-enable them only once new puzzle loads |

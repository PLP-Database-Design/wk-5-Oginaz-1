## 1. Test Plan

### 1.1 Test Objectives

The primary objectives of this test plan are to:

- **Functionality Verification:** Ensure all core game features (Reset Game, Leaderboard, Bonus Round) operate as specified
- **Data Integrity:** Validate correct score calculation, leaderboard persistence, and state management
- **Risk Mitigation:** Identify and test high-risk areas including localStorage operations, bonus round logic, and edge cases
- **Quality Assurance:** Maintain game stability, user experience, and data consistency across all interactions
- **Team Collaboration:** Demonstrate effective test management through proper planning, execution, and monitoring

### 1.2 Scope

#### In Scope
- **Functional Testing:**
  - Reset Game functionality and state management
  - Leaderboard storage and retrieval from localStorage
  - Bonus Round calculation and trigger logic
  - Score calculation with hints and without hints
  - Puzzle scrambling and validation
  - Hint display and cost deduction
  
- **Non-Functional Testing:**
  - Usability and accessibility testing
  - Browser compatibility (Chrome desktop focus)
  - User interface responsiveness
  - Error handling and edge cases

#### Out of Scope
- Cross-browser testing beyond Chrome desktop
- Performance testing under load
- Security testing of localStorage
- Mobile device testing
- Network connectivity scenarios
- Backend server integration

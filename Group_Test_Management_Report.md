## 1. Test Plan

### 1.1 Test Objectives

The primary objectives of this test plan are to:

- **Functionality Verification:** Ensure all core game features (Reset Game, Leaderboard, Bonus Round) operate as specified
- **Data Integrity:** Validate correct score calculation, leaderboard persistence, and state management
- **Risk Mitigation:** Identify and test high-risk areas including localStorage operations, bonus round logic, and edge cases
- **Quality Assurance:** Maintain game stability, user experience, and data consistency across all interactions
- **Team Collaboration:** Demonstrate effective test management through proper planning, execution, and monitoring

### 1.2 Scope

#### In Scope
- **Functional Testing:**
  - Reset Game functionality and state management
  - Leaderboard storage and retrieval from localStorage

## 2. Risk Analysis
### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
|R01 |Reset Button |Game state may not reset all variables |Medium |High |High |Validate all state variables and UI values reset correctly |
|R02 |Leader Board |Incorrect Score sorting or overwriting of scores |Medium |Medium |Critical |Test boundary values and local storage persistence |
|R03 |Bonus Round |Logic error could double at wrong time |Medium |Medium |Medium |Test with cumulative solves and verify arithmetic logic |
|R04 |Hint Bonus |Hint points may not be deducted when score is zero |Medium |Medium |High |Validate deduction logic and arithmetic |
|R05 |Input Validation |Empty input   |low |Medium |Low |Add validation message and error messages |
|R06 |UI |Screen readers may not get updates |Low |Medium |Low |Verify Accessibility tags in Browser |
|R07 |Submit Button |Clicking submit rapidly multiple times before next puzzle loads causing repeated score increments and false bonus triggers. |High |High |High |Disable Submit and Hint buttons immediately after a correct guess, and re-enable them only once new puzzle loads |

### Risk Coverage

- Tested Risks Percent: 86% (6 out 7 risks tested)

## Lessons Learned

- Most Defect Prone Feature: Hint System
- Risk Analysis Impact: Did focus on bonus system,submit and hint button
- Team Communication Effectiveness: Cross-channel updates (GitHub + WhatsApp) reduced blockers and sped decisions.
- Improvements for Next Cycle: Automate regression (smoke tests) and tighten control on post-solve state.
